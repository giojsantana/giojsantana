# Hi, I’m Giovanni!
## I’m interested in history, mostly the hundred years war between france and england, I am also interested in video games like project zomboid, crusader kings, valorant, the binding of isaac, and cyberpunk 2077 which is my favorite.
## I’m currently learning web development (html, css, js) and I am excited to eventually start learning react
